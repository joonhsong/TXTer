# TXTer
This is source code for my web texting/messenger application.
The purpose of this application is to develop a messenger app that not only clones SNS applications, but also
specialize in communication within specific group of people.
Users can log in with Github or Google account or create a separate account.

Special thanks to Antonio Erdeljac for tutorial and reference.
