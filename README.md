This is source code for my web texting/messenger application.
The purpose of this application is to develop a messenger app that not only clones the Messenger applications
from Meta (Facebook), but also specialize in communication within specific group of people.
Users can log in with Github or Google account or create a separate account.

Special thanks to Antonio Erdeljac for tutorial and reference.
